My machine hangs or acts strange:
->  did you try with less undervolting or without undervolting?

My machine is still throttling:
-> did you turn of/stop,disable,uninstall thermald?
-> did you check for dust and do you have clean fans and such?

Keep in mind your hardware might put you some limits which you can't fix with software.

Yes I did read the readme carefully ;)
What is it about?
Details?
which CPU? Laptop?
Configuration?
